<p class="c111">Lilith Pleasant first appeared back in The Sims 2 as a child,<br> along with her twin sister Angela. In The Sims 4, she's all grown up and studying a Villainy<br> degree at Foxbury Institute. She lives with her sister in Britechester<br> town as Angela attends Britechester University.

<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Judith_Ward" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si5.jpg" alt="Judith Ward" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p class="c2">Arguably Del Sol Valley's biggest celebrity, Judith Ward is mostly known for her many marriages and divorces as well as her ruthless pursuit of fame at any cost. She's also known to appear constantly in random places.
Regardless of if you think she's a legend or a loser, you won't fail to spot her around town. It often seems like she's attend the opening of an envelope. You may not like her but you have to admire her persistence.</p>
</div>
<div class="br3">
  <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Yamachan" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si6.jpg" alt="Yamachan" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p class="c3">Now we know that Snowy Escape's epic mascot Yamachan doesn't live in Mt. Komorebi but he is a character and there's no denying that he's become truly iconic in the short time we've known him.
He loves to dance, cheers up kids, runs the Voidcritter festivallooks amazing and even has statues dedicated to him. Can you name a more iconic celebration of greatness? Yamachan has captured the hearts of Sims fans everywhere </p>
</div>

  <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Greenburg_family" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si7.jpg" alt="Greenburg family" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
  <p class="c4">Don't make us choose between these Sims! When The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle dropped we fell in love with their beautiful home and unique story. Mary and Blossom are an elder lesbian couple and Knox is their adopted grandson who has a desire to change the world.They stood out for all the right reasons and a few months later we found out why. The family were actually created on The Sims Spark'd by The English Simmer and Plumbella, with their home being built by Simproved. Now they will always have a legacy as the first ever player created family </p>
</div>
<div class="br5">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki_Beh" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si8.jpg" alt="Yuki Behr" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>While Candy Behr from Get Together may be the famous DJ, it's younger sister Yuki who has our hearts. From her vibrant turquoise hair to her loner geek personality she's cuter and more relatable to us than her sister.
We love exploring the life of the youngest Behr sister as she makes a path for herself with her more unconventional interests and skills, which include hacking!Yuki is a teen, 13 days away from becoming a young adult. She is a high school student with a C grade and carries a homework book in her inventory.She has six skill points in video gaming She has six skill points in video gaming .<p>

<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Akira_Kibo" traget="_blank"><img src="../media/si9.jpg" alt="Morgyn Ember" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>Morgyn Ember has cemented himself as our favorite sage and spellcaster since he first caught our eye in the Realm of Magic trailers. A true icon, he has a feminine style that suits him perfectly and an eye for chaos.
As the Sage of Untamed Magic, he can teach your sims some truly amazing spells and he is also great fun to chat with. An outgoing personality, quirky nature and incredibly spellcasting prowess make him an easy choice for this list.Akira Kibo is a pre-made Sim </p>
</div>
<div class="br7">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Nancy_Landgraab" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si10.jpg" alt="Nancy_Landgraab" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>Love her or hate her, The Sims 4 would be literally nothing without her since her family owns a large number of properties in the town. They also appear to own several apartment buildings, given their names.She works as a minor crimelord, which explains the money, and is the absolute boss of the household. Her husband Malcolm is very much under her thumb and her sassy personality and shady career make her a (mob) legend in the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="br8">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Don_Lothario" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si11.jpg" alt="Don_Lothario" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>Don Lothario is very aptly named and his role in The Sims seems to be to upset the balance of the Caliente household. The Caliente's themselves have been through a few troubles and it doesn't look set to stop in The Sims 4.
If you venture into this household you'll soon see Don living up to his surname by romancing both Caliente sisters, while being romantically tied to their mother. Don has become iconic due to his drama ensuring and yet predictable behavior. He adds spice .</p>
</div>
<div class="br9">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Bob_Pancakes" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si12.jpg" alt="Bob_Pancakes" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>Bob Pancakes is a living icon. He starred in the game's trailer and is a much-loved presence in the game. He lives with his wife Eliza, and there is another version of his household that includes a toddler named Iggy.
Most players will have directly controlled or interacted with this legend, many of them to save him from Eliza, who has also become equally iconic as a sim players love to get rid of in interesting ways.Bob Pancakes is a pre-made Sim  </p>
</div>
<div class="br10">
  <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Oliana_Ngata" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si13.jpg" alt="Oliana_Ngata" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
  <p>Oliana and her wife Leila are the first lesbian couple to be featured in the main game, with the only previous one being The Shears, who came with Sims 3's Roaring Heights, the final world available on the Sims 3 store.Oliana has a son, who appears to be from a previous relationship, suggesting she is the bisexual icon we're all been waiting for. Her wife Leila has a different surname but the pair are married. They live in Sulani with Tane, Oliana's son</p>
</div>
<div class="br11">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Lia_Hauata" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si14.png" alt="Lia_Hauata" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>Lia Huata lives in Sulani with their grandmother. They are a young adult with a masculine body frame but the ability to get pregnant. The Sims considers them to be the first pre-made non-binary character in the game.
Their status is iconic as a mark of diversity within the game. Island Living introduced many new cultural elements to the game and Lia's inclusion has also been suggested as a reference to māhū, the third gender in Polynesian and Hawaiian culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="br12">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Hecking_family" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si15.png" alt="Hecking_family" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>We cannot choose between this iconic couple, the franchise's first pre-made gay couple. Brant and Brent are total relationship goals and live happily in Brindleton Bay, together with their dog Rosie.Since we first saw Brent on the cover of Cats & Dogs we knew he was a legend. He pursues a career as a painter, while Brant is a personal trainer. If anyone splits this pair up in their game then we consider you to be truly chaotic evil.</p>
</div>
<div class="br13">
  <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Bella_Goth" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si16.jpg" alt="Bella_Goth" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
  <p>No list of iconic Sims characters would be complete without the queen herself, Bella Goth. In The Sims 4, the family history is considered an alternative universe but yet Bella herself continues to shine through the chaos.
This time around she is a wife and mother, living in a suitably dark and old-fashioned mansion with her husband and two children. Despite the time slip, she's still a lady of prestige, class, and mystery and remains a firm fan favorite.</p>
  </div>
<div class="br14">
<a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Vladislaus_Straud" target="_blank"><img src="../media/si17.jpg" alt="Vladislaus_Straud" width="200px" height="150px"></a>
<p>Count Vladislaus Straud IV is a legend in Forgotten Hollow. He brings wisdom, age, and knowledge to the town which boasts a huge statue of him in the center. While he is foreboding and intense, many players have been enjoying bringing out his lighter side.
Vlad, as he is usually known as, has been given makeovers and a new lease of life. However, for others, he is hated for his tendency to sneak into your home at night. Love him or hate him you cannot deny </p>
